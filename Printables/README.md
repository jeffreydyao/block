# Printables

This folder contains 3D models for printing with a 3D printer to use with Block. Each model contains an embedded cavity near the top of the model, where a 25mm NTAG215 NFC sticker is placed. The NFC tag lets you tap your device to the object to start a Block session. The models are provided as `.3mf` files.

## Embedding the NFC tag

The models are designed for use with **25mm circular rewritable/programmable NTAG215 NFC stickers**, with a **0.15mm thickness (+/-0.04)**.

25mm NTAG215 NFC stickers are readily available on Amazon and AliExpress, commonly in a pack of 12 for less than $10 AUD.

To insert the NFC tag, import the `.3mf` file to your slicer and add a pause at the bottom of the cavity. When your print pauses, stick a NFC sticker into the cavity, then resume the print.
